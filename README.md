# Lock-your-mercedes-with-Alexa

## Use Case:
Lock your car using your Amazon Alexa.

## Reason for choosing this Use Case:
1. **Get and set information:**
Since the experimental API is a little bit limited in forms of sending commands to the vehicle I chose the only Use Case, that not only retrieves information but also sends commands out to the vehicle.
2. **Real world application:**
This seems to me like a pretty common Use Case that could be used in real world applications
